# Plant Classification Model used by Explora
This is the machine classification model made specifically for Explora application that we developed. The model can classify and identify 30 types of plants. 

## Datasets
For this task, we used dataset from the Kaggle user [yudhaislamisulistya](https://www.kaggle.com/yudhaislamisulistya). This datasets consists of 30 species of plants, each species has 100 image each. The datasets itself has already been split into 3 types of data (train, test, validation), which made the classification task more convinient. Kaggle datasets can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yudhaislamisulistya/plants-type-datasets/code).

## EfficientNetB0 Architecture
EfficientNetB0 is a model in the EfficientNet family, a group of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for high efficiency in terms of both accuracy and computational resource usage. EfficientNetB0 represents a significant step in developing resource-efficient yet highly accurate models, suitable for a wide range of image processing applications

## Model Performance
Using transfer learning implementation of the EfficientNetB0 model, we achieved admirable results for the accuracy, and its loss. We believed that the model can be improved.
